# This file is intentionally empty, because each Perun instance needs a separate key.
# Generate a real ssh key with:
#
#   ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -C "perun engine" -N "" -f id_ed25519
#
# then put the generated files into files/{{ inventory_hostname}}/ and encrypt the private key as vault with:
#
#   ansible-vault encrypt files/...hostname.../id_ed25519
#
# then apply the playbook again with "--tags perun_engine".

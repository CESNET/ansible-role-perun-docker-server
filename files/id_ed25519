# This file is intentionally empty, because each Perun instance needs a separate key.
# On your Ansible controller host, in the git repo containing the playbook_perun.yml,
# generate a real ssh key in files/{{ perun_instance_hostname}}/ with:
#
#   cd files/...hostname.../
#   ssh-keygen -q -t ed25519 -C "perun engine" -N "" -f id_ed25519
#
# then encrypt the private key as vault with:
#
#   ansible-vault encrypt files/...hostname.../id_ed25519
#
# and define the following variables in the YAML file with Ansible variables in host_vars/...hostname.../:
#
#  perun_engine_ssh_privkey_file: id_ed25519
#  perun_engine_ssh_pubkey_file: id_ed25519.pub
#
# then apply the playbook again with "--tags perun_engine".
